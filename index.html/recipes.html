            <h3>Chocolate Fudge Cake</h3>
            <p>Ingredients:
🔹 For the Cake:
1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour

1 cup (200g) white sugar

½ cup (50g) unsweetened cocoa powder

1 tsp baking soda

½ tsp baking powder

½ tsp salt

1 egg

½ cup (120ml) milk

¼ cup (60ml) vegetable oil

½ cup (120ml) hot water

1 tsp vanilla extract

🔹 For the Whipped Cream:
1 cup (240ml) heavy whipping cream (chilled)

2 tbsp powdered sugar

½ tsp vanilla extract

👩‍🍳 Instructions
✅ Step 1: Preheat the oven
Preheat your oven to 175°C (350°F).

Grease a 7 or 8-inch round cake pan and dust lightly with flour or line with baking paper.

✅ Step 2: Make the Cake Batter
In a bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.

Add sugar, then mix all dry ingredients well.

Add the egg, milk, and oil. Mix until smooth using a hand whisk or spoon.

Stir in hot water slowly (batter will be thin, but that’s okay—it makes it moist!).

Add vanilla extract and mix again.

✅ Step 3: Bake the Cake
Pour the batter into the prepared pan.

Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.

Let it cool completely before adding whipped cream.

🍦 Make the Whipped Cream
In a chilled bowl, pour the cold whipping cream.

Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract.

Beat with a hand mixer (or whisk) until soft peaks form.

Don’t overmix — stop when it holds shape but still looks creamy.

🎂 Final Touch – Frost the Cake
Spread the whipped cream evenly on top of the cooled cake.

Decorate with chocolate shavings, cocoa powder, or strawberries (optional).

            <h3>Fresh Fruit Salad</h3>
            <p>📝 Ingredients:
You can use any of your favorite fruits, but here’s a great mix:

1 cup apple (chopped)

1 cup banana (sliced)

1 cup grapes (cut in half if big)

1 cup pineapple (chopped)

1 cup watermelon or mango (chopped)

1 orange (peeled and separated)

1 tablespoon lemon juice

1 tablespoon honey (optional)

A pinch of black salt or chat masala (optional, for a tangy twist)

Few fresh mint leaves (for garnish)

👩‍🍳 Instructions:
Wash and chop all the fruits into bite-sized pieces.

Place them in a large mixing bowl.

Drizzle with lemon juice and honey. This adds flavor and keeps the apples/bananas from browning.

If you like a tangy flavor, add a pinch of black salt or chat masala.

Toss everything gently so fruits are well coated.

Garnish with mint leaves.

Serve immediately, or refrigerate for 15–30 minutes before serving for a chilled version.

200g ladyfinger biscuits (also called Savoiardi)

250g mascarpone cheese (cold)

1 cup heavy whipping cream

⅓ cup sugar (or to taste)

1 tsp vanilla extract

1 cup strong black coffee (cooled, no sugar)

Make the cream:

In a large bowl, whisk heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract until soft peaks form.

Prepare the coffee:

Pour the cooled coffee into a shallow bowl. Add liqueur if using.

Layer the dessert:

Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee (1–2 seconds, don’t soak!).

Arrange a layer of dipped biscuits at the bottom of a square or rectangular dish.

Spread half of the cream mixture over the biscuits and smooth it out.

Repeat:

Add another layer of dipped ladyfingers.

Spread the rest of the cream on top and smooth it nicely.

Chill:

Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight for best results.
